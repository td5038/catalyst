The cult of Wii is a group made by notorious cult leader Immoloism when he booted Gentoo Linux on a Wii. A small group formed around his ideals of cross-compiling software, building custom kernels, and using build tools such as catalyst with qemu-user. His methods spread far and wide, gaining a large audience who would eventually go on to pay for his 'Tesco Meal Deals' (TMD for short). As his ranks grew, well-renowned members gained status through a currency known as 'Channel Points', of which they used to change the leader's desktop wallpapers - often to humourous effect. Soon, the cult grew to an international community, with its efforts spread to other consoles such as the Playstation 2 and the 3DS - becoming known by its signature use of a Peppa Pig naming scheme. Once known as Ningentoo - the cult now stands as being internationally recognised in bringing such horror as Linux 5.x kernels to obsolete hardware.

On a more serious note, thanks for using Xenia Linux! It means a great deal to us all!
